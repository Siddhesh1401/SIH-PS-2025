# Remote classroom for rural colleges

**Problem Statement ID:** 25101

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Description

Background: Rural diploma colleges often operate without subject Lecturers in various fields such as artificial intelligence, VLSI, or renewable energy. Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide. Description: The challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.
