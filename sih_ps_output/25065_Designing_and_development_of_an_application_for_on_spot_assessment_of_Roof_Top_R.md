# Designing and development of an application for on spot assessment of Roof Top Rain water harvesting and artificial recharge potential and size of the RTRWH and AR.

**Problem Statement ID:** 25065

**Organization:** Ministry of Jal Shakti

**Department:** Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

Background Groundwater replenishment is a critical factor for the augmentation and sustainability of water resources in the country. There is significant potential in both rural and urban areas for harvesting rainwater from individual rooftops. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has published several scientific manuals and reports on rooftop rainwater harvesting (RTRWH) potential, as well as FAQs and practical guides for artificial recharge. However, there is currently no user-friendly digital platform where individuals can directly assess their rainwater harvesting potential. Proposed Solution To promote public participation in groundwater conservation, it is proposed to develop a web/mobile application that enables users to easily estimate the feasibility of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RTRWH) and artificial recharge at their locations. By entering simple details such as name, location, number of dwellers, roof area, and available open space, the system will generate personalized outputs using GIS-based and algorithmic models. Key Features - Feasibility check for rooftop rainwater harvesting - Suggested type of RTRWH/Artificial Recharge structures - Information on principal aquifer in the area - Depth to groundwater level - Local rainfall data - Runoff generation capacity - Recommended dimensions of recharge pits, trenches, and shafts - Cost estimation and cost-benefit analysis Impact The application will empower individuals and communities to take informed decisions about groundwater conservation and rainwater harvesting. It will enhance public awareness, encourage participation, and support sustainable water management efforts. The tool should also support regional languages for better accessibility and inclusivity.
