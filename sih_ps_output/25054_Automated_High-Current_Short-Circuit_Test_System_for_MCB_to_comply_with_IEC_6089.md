# Automated High-Current Short-Circuit Test System for MCB to comply with IEC 60898-1:2015

**Problem Statement ID:** 25054

**Organization:** Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (MoCA,F&PD)

**Department:** National Test House,Department of Consumer Affairs

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

Background The safety of electrical installations hinges on reliable Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs). IEC 60898-1:2015 mandates rigorous short-circuit breaking capacity tests, crucial for ensuring MCBs perform correctly under severe fault conditions. Existing Problem Current manual or semi-automated testing methods for MCBs introduce significant challenges. These include imprecise R (resistive) and XL (inductive) circuit configurations, increased test times, and elevated safety risks for personnel during high-energy fault current generation (up to 10,000A). This impacts test accuracy, repeatability, and overall safety in the MCB certification process. Detailed Description This proposal outlines an automated machine to precisely control test currents, voltages, and circuit impedance, executing high-current short-circuit tests on single pole, SPN, DP, TP, and FP MCBs (0.5A-63A) per IEC 60898-1:2015. It features an Automated R and XL Circuit Combination Module with high-power, automatically switched banks for precise power factor control. A High-Current Power Source (transformer-based) delivers up to 10,000A. The Test Station includes universal MCB mounting and a critical arc chute for safety. A sophisticated Control and Data Acquisition System (PLC/Industrial PC) manages tests, captures high-speed waveforms, and analyzes data. A user-friendly HMI allows parameter input and automatic report generation. Comprehensive safety systems are integrated.
