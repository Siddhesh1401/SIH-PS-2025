# Detection and Prevention of Tampering in Weighing and Measuring instruments

**Problem Statement ID:** 25058

**Organization:** Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (MoCA,F&PD)

**Department:** Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Description

Background Weighing and measuring instruments are critical components in trade, industry, health, agriculture, and public safety. They ensure fair transactions and consumer trust when used accurately. However, tampering with such instruments, especially digital weighing scales, fuel dispensers, water/electricity meters, and retail POS systems-leads to fraudulent trade practices, losses to consumers, and damage to the integrity of commerce. Tampering may involve unauthorized hardware modifications, altered firmware, embedded malware, hidden switches, or even remote-control manipulation. These alterations are designed to evade detection by regulators while enabling cheating during operation. Problem Description Develop a robust and intelligent system to detect, prevent, and alert against tampering in weighing and measuring instruments. The system must be capable of identifying both physical and digital tampering attempts in real time or near-real time. It should ideally include an embedded solution with secure logging, alert triggers, and remote verification capability by Legal Metrology officers. The proposed solution may also leverage Al/ML, digital forensics, tamper-evident Hardware seals, blockchain-backed audit trails, or sensor-based integrity checks. Key Functional Requirements Tamper Detection: -Detect unauthorized access to device internals (e.g., seals broken, circuit modifications, etc.) -Monitor anomalies in calibration, weight drift, or suspicious patterns -Firmware Integrity -Secure boot or hash verification for firmware changes -Logging of unauthorized software firmware updates Alert System: -Instant tamper alerts to remote Legal Metrology dashboards -Optional local visual/audio alarms on tamper detection Data Logging & Traceability: -Immutable logs of measurements, maintenance, and access events -Optionally backed by blockchain or secure cloud Remote Monitoring: -IoT integration to transmit logs to a centralized monitoring system -GPS/ geotagging to detect movement of stationary devices Target Participants Final year UG (B.Tech/B.E) students in Electronics, Embedded Systems, Instrumentation, AI/ML. Cybersecurity -PG/Ph.D. researchers in IoT Security, Metrology, Data Forensics -Startups or academia-industry teams working on compliance technologies Evaluation Criteria -Innovation (new methods of detection or prevention) -Accuracy of tamper detection (false positive/negative rates) -Feasibility and cost of integrating the solution into common instruments -User Interface & Regulatory Dashboard usability -Readiness for field deployment and validation Expected Deliverables (a) Prototype device or software module to detect tampering (hardware and/or firmware) (b) Dashboard or interface for regulators to view alerts and device health (c) Tamper-logging and reporting features (d) Validation data from controlled tamper scenarios (e) Whitepaper/ technical documentation describing architecture, logic, limitations and future potential Benefits and Impact -Strengthens consumer protection and fairness in trade -Builds a proactive regulatory ecosystem using smart devices -Reduces inspection burden via automated alerting -Enables certification of tamper-proof weighing/measuring instruments -Contributes to digital trust in India's commerce and metrology infrastructure Mentorship and Resources -Mentorship from Legal Metrology and cybersecuirty experts -Access to LM Act & Rules/ OIML Recommendations, guidelines, testing labs, etc. Future Prospects -Development of National Digital Registry for compliant instruments -Integration with e-maap portal for real-time monitoring -Standardization of tamper-detection modules in certified devices -Development of tamper-proof metrology solutions
