# Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System

**Problem Statement ID:** 25046

**Organization:** Government of Odisha

**Department:** Electronics & IT Department

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Clean & Green Technology

## Description

Description Design an IoT-enabled waste segregation system using sensors and machine learning to automatically classify household waste (organic, recyclable, hazardous) at the source. The system should integrate with municipal waste management for efficient collection and recycling. Expected Outcome A prototype device with 90% accuracy in waste classification, coupled with a mobile app for households to monitor waste disposal and earn incentives for recycling. Technical Feasibility Uses affordable sensors (e.g., cameras, weight sensors) and ML models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for waste identification, deployable in urban and semi-urban areas.
