# Research and redesign a sport equipment commonly found in sport industry and utilize Fusion software to reimagine its design. Students can use Fusion Features such as Generative Design, Topology Optimization, Additive Build etc. The redesigned component should showcase innovation, enhanced functionality, and improved efficiency, all while being optimized for 3D printing.

**Problem Statement ID:** 25095

**Organization:** Autodesk

**Department:** Autodesk

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Description

The student's focus should be on using Fusion's additive manufacturing capabilities. They should aim to learn about additive manufacturing and its applications in “sports equipment design”. This includes studying how to design sports gear with considerations for structural integrity, performance enhancement, and weight reduction. They should define project objectives and design constraints and then utilize generative design tools in Fusion to explore and generate optimized designs. The student should evaluate these designs using simulation and analysis tools within Fusion. They should refine and iterate on the designs to further enhance performance. Finally, they should prototype and test the finalized design using appropriate 3D printing technologies.
