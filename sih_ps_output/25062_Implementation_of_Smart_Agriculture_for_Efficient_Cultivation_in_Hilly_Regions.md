# Implementation of Smart Agriculture for Efficient Cultivation in Hilly Regions

**Problem Statement ID:** 25062

**Organization:** Government of Sikkim

**Department:** Department of Higher & Technical Education

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Description

Background The agricultural region of Jorethang in South Sikkim experiences harsh, rainless summers and frequent water scarcity, making traditional irrigation unreliable and inefficient. Farmers struggle to provide adequate water to crops, often leading to reduced yields and wasted resources. With climate change intensifying these issues, there's a pressing need for a sustainable, smart irrigation approach that maximizes water efficiency and crop productivity. Integrating rainwater harvesting, sensor-based monitoring, and crop-specific intelligence offers a forward-thinking solution to these regional challenges. Proposed Solution AgroSmart: A Sensor-Based Smart Irrigation System with Crop Intelligence and Rainwater Harvesting. This system aims to provide affordable, automated irrigation tailored to each crop’s needs using soil moisture and environmental sensors. It integrates a rainwater harvesting unit with real-time water level monitoring, ensuring efficient water use even during dry periods. The solution will include: - Soil moisture and temperature sensors to monitor field conditions. - A crop database that determines optimal watering levels. - Automated valve control through microcontrollers (Arduino/ESP32). - Rainwater harvesting with level sensors to track available water. - A mobile/web dashboard for farmers to monitor data and control irrigation remotely. - Alerts and updates via SMS or app to keep farmers informed. Impact Conserves water, improves crop yields, minimizes manual labour, and helps farmers in Jorethang adapt to climate variability with a smart, self-sustaining irrigation system.
