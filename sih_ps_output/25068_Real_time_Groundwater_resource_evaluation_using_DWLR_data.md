# Real time Groundwater resource evaluation using DWLR data

**Problem Statement ID:** 25068

**Organization:** Ministry of Jal Shakti

**Department:** Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Description

Background Groundwater is central to India's drinking, agricultural, and industrial water needs. Despite covering an area of 3.3 million square kilometers and being home to 16% of the global population, India has only 4% of the world's freshwater resources. This limited availability, combined with uneven distribution, overexploitation in some regions, and changing climate scenarios, highlights the urgent need for sustainable groundwater management. Resource knowledge is integral to the effective management of resources. Proposed Solution To strengthen groundwater management, it is proposed to design a mobile application that utilizes data from 5,260 DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder) stations spread across the country. These stations provide high-frequency water level data, which can be leveraged to: - Analyze real-time water level fluctuations - Estimate recharge dynamically - Evaluate groundwater resources in real time Key Features - Mobile app integration with DWLR station datasets - Visualization of water level trends and recharge patterns - Real-time groundwater availability estimation - Decision-support features for researchers, planners, and policymakers Impact The designed app will enable stakeholders, groundwater researchers, and decision makers to have quick access to real-time groundwater availability. This will aid in scientific evaluation, informed decision-making, and the proposal of effective groundwater management interventions.
