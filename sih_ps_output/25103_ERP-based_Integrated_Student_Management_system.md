# ERP-based Integrated Student Management system

**Problem Statement ID:** 25103

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

Background: Admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview. Description: Comprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate.                                                                                                                    Expected Solution: Teams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.
