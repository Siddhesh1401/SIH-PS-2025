**Problem Statement ID:** 25104

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Description

Background: Campus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners.. Description: While answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.
