# Smart Traffic Management Systern for Urban Congestion

**Problem Statement ID:** 25050

**Organization:** Government of Odisha

**Department:** Electronics & IT Department

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Transportation & Logistics

## Description

Description Design an AI-based traffic management system to optimize signal timings and reduce congestion in urban areas. The system should analyze real-time traffic data from cameras and IoT sensors to predict and mitigate bottlenecks. Expected Outcome A software prototype reducing average commute time by 10% in a simulated urban environment, with a dashboard for traffic authorities to monitor and control signals. Technical Feasibility Uses computer vision (e.g., OpenCV) and reinforcement learning for traffic prediction, integrated with existing traffic camera networks.
