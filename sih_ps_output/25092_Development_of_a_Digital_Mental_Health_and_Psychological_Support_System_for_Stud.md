## Description

Problem Statement: Context: Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges. Problem Faced: - Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system. - Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools. - Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness. - No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions. Proposed Technological Challenge: Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and/or mobile app) with the following capabilities: 1. AI-guided First-Aid Support: Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed. 2. Confidential Booking System: For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline. 3. Psychoeducational Resource Hub: Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages. 4. Peer Support Platform: Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers. 5. Admin Dashboard: Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions.
