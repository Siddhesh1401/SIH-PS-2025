# AI based development of Laser based QR Code marking on 'track fittings on Indian Railways'.

**Problem Statement ID:** 25021

**Organization:** Ministry of Railways

**Department:** Ministry of Railways

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Transportation & Logistics

## Description

Background Indian Railways procures about 10 crore Elastic Rail Clips, 5 crore liners, and 8.5 crore rail pads annually. There is currently no system for identification of these track fittings—i.e., elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners—and sleepers, with integration to the UDM portal enabling mobile-based scanning for vendor lot number, date of supply, warranty period, inspection dates, etc. This gap is critical for quality assessment and performance management of fittings. Description This problem statement envisages a unified system for laser-based QR code marking on track fittings to enable mobile scanning and identification of elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners, and sleepers, along with integration to the UDM (User Depot Module) on www.ireps.gov.in and the TMS (Track Management System) on www.irecept.gov.in. With the use of AI, the system should extract all essential details of each fitting item, including inspections at all stages—from manufacturing and supply to in-service performance—and pinpoint exceptions for quality monitoring. Laser-based QR codes are already prevalent in other industries.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

Innovative solutions are invited through Smart India Hackathon 2025 to develop and implement a system addressing identification of bulk supply materials, their performance issues, and effective inventory management and quality monitoring actions for safety performance of fittings. • Hardware Solution: Design and implement laser-based QR code imprints on bulk supply items of track fittings and sleepers. • Software Solution: Develop QR code linkage and integrate with the UDM and TMS portals; enable mobile scans to generate AI-based reports related to vendor, supply, warranty, inspections, and support inventory management, etc.
