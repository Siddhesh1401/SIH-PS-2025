# Comprehensive Cloud-Based Practice Management & Nutrient Analysis Software for Ayurvedic Dietitians, Tailored for Ayurveda-Focused Diet Plans

**Problem Statement ID:** 25024

**Organization:** Ministry of Ayush

**Department:** All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech

## Description

Background Currently, in Ayurvedic hospitals, diet charts are prescribed manually by doctors in handwritten form, tailored to each patient’s needs. Existing software solutions primarily focus on macro- and micro-nutrient tracking but fail to align with Ayurvedic nutritional concepts. This gap creates inefficiencies, reduces accuracy, and makes it harder for practitioners to deliver holistic dietary care rooted in Ayurveda. Detailed Description The problem envisages the development of a dedicated Ayurvedic Diet Management Software designed to efficiently create, manage, and organize patient-specific diet charts with both accuracy and ease. Unlike conventional nutrition tools, the platform will integrate modern nutritional metrics with Ayurvedic dietary principles —such as caloric value, food properties (Hot/Cold, Easy/Difficult to digest), and the six tastes (Rasa).
