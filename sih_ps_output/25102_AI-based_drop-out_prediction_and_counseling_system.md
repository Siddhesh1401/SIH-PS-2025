## Description

Background: By the time term-end marks reveal failures, many struggling students have disengaged beyond recovery. Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier. Description: Attendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously. Commercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system must be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using machine learning. Expected SoIution: Participants  are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based  thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.
