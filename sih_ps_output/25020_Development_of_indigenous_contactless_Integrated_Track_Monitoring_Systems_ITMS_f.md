# Development of indigenous contactless Integrated Track Monitoring Systems (ITMS) for Track Recording on Indian Railways

**Problem Statement ID:** 25020

**Organization:** Ministry of Railways

**Department:** Ministry of Railways

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

Background Indian Railways employs Track Recording Cars (TRCs) for periodic assessment of track geometry to ensure safety, ride comfort, and operational efficiency. While some TRCs still use outdated, contact-based systems, others rely on imported contactless technologies—typically laser-based solutions integrated with proprietary software. These foreign systems pose several challenges: • High procurement and maintenance costs • Limited customization capabilities • Dependency on external vendors and closed-source software To address these issues and promote self-reliance, Indian Railways invites proposals for the Development of indigenous contactless Integrated Track Monitoring Systems (ITMS) for Track Recording on Indian Railways. Objective Design and develop a comprehensive, indigenous Integrated Track Monitoring System that: • Fully complies with RDSO Specification TM/IM/448, Rev. 1: 2023 and EN 13848 standards. • Supports modularity, ease of maintenance, and cost efficiency. Technical Scope Sub-systems: • Track geometry measurement system • Full rail profile and wear measurement system • Condition monitoring of track components • Acceleration measurement system • Infringement measurement to MMD/SOD • Rear window video recording system Data Acquisition & Sampling: • Sampling interval: 25 cm • Operable under dynamic loads at speeds from 0–200 km/h • Real-time acquisition and processing capability Data Processing & Analysis: • Onboard server for real-time data filtering and analysis • Software must: – Eliminate environmental and operational noise – Extract and analyze track geometry parameters & track component conditions – Comply with EN 13848 Part 1 & 2 and RDSO TM/IM/448, Rev. 1: 2023 accuracy standards Output & Storage: • Chainage-mapped outputs for: – Track Geometry: Gauge, alignment, unevenness, twist, cross level, curve – Dynamic Parameters: Vertical & lateral acceleration – Rail Condition: Profile and wear – Track Components: Rail surface, fastenings, ballast, sleepers – Synchronized rear-view video footage – Exportable data in standard formats (CSV, XML, JPEG, AVI) • Secure storage and archival capability Key Performance Parameters • Maximum Speed: 200 km/h • Sampling Rate: 25 cm • Accuracy: As per EN 13848 Part 2 & RDSO TM/IM/448, Rev. 1: 2023 • Real-time Processing: Required • Chainage Mapping: Mandatory (via axle encoder) Eligibility Open to: • Startups • Entrepreneurs • Academic & research institutions • Industry professionals and R&D organizations • Collaborative consortia involving any of the above Evaluation Criteria • Technical feasibility and innovation – 10 marks • Standards compliance (EN 13848 & RDSO TM/IM/448, Rev. 1:2023) – 40 marks • Hardware robustness, modularity & compactness – 20 marks • Software usability & architecture – 10 marks • Scalability, maintainability & upgradability – 10 marks • Cost-effectiveness – 10 marks Total = 100 marks Deliverables Successful participants must submit: • A fully functional prototype (hardware + software) • Comprehensive technical documentation • Validation report demonstrating standards compliance • Video demonstration (lab/field performance) • Cost analysis and scalability roadmap Conclusion This initiative is a step toward achieving technological independence in railway infrastructure monitoring. By fostering domestic innovation, Indian Railways aims to reduce reliance on foreign systems, cut long-term costs, and deploy tailored solutions better suited to India’s operational context.
