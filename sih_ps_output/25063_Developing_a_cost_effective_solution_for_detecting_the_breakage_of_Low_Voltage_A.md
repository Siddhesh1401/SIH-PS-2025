# Developing a cost effective solution for detecting the breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors

**Problem Statement ID:** 25063

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Disaster Management

## Description

Background A cost-effective solution is required for detecting the breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors towards isolating the source of supply to prevent hazardous electric shock scenarios to the public, while also sending alarms to the concerned section office for immediate fault rectification. Recently, several cases of accidental deaths of children and adults due to electrocution from broken live conductors lying on the ground were reported in Kerala. Low voltage distribution lines often snap due to falling trees during natural calamities and also due to aging or corrosion. This dangerous condition is not detected or isolated by upstream fuses in these feeders because of high earth resistance and low fault current, leading to electrocution deaths when people come into contact with live bare conductors. Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.
