# Al-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Advancing Circulanty and Sustainability in Metallurgy and Mining

**Problem Statement ID:** 25069

**Organization:** Ministry of Mines

**Department:** Jawaharlal Nehru Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre (JNARDDC)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Description

Background As industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals like aluminium and copper, vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure, undergo multiple stages — from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste. Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a circular economy where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized. Problem Statement There is a need to design an intuitive, AI-powered software platform that enables metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals such as aluminium, copper, or critical minerals, with a special emphasis on circularity . Proposed Solution The platform should: - Allow users to input or select process and production details (including raw vs. recycled routes, energy use, transport, and end-of-life options). - Use AI/ML models to estimate missing parameters and predict both environmental and circularity indicators (e.g., recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, potential for reuse). - Visualize circular flow opportunities alongside environmental impacts across the full value chain — from raw material extraction through reuse or recycling. - Enable easy comparison of conventional and circular processing pathways. - Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when users have limited data or specialized expertise. Impact With this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that foster environmental sustainability while advancing circular, resource-efficient systems.
