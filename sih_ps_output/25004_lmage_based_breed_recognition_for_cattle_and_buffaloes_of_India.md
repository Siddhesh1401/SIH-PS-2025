# lmage based breed recognition for cattle and buffaloes of India

**Problem Statement ID:** 25004

**Organization:** Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

**Department:** Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Description

Background The Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions. Description Breed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes. To address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images. • Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and varying animal poses. • Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses). • Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA. • Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries. • Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.
