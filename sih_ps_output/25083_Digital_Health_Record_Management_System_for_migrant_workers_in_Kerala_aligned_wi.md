## Description

Kerala hosts a significant migrant population lacking comprehensive health record systems. These individuals often serve as a carrier for infectious diseases, posing serious public health risks to local communities. A dedicated software solution for maintaining migrant health records would support SDG achievement, prevent disease transmission and enhance public health surveillance and assist in elimination of diseases while ensuring fair and impartial healthcare access.
