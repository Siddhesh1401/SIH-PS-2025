## Description

Kolams (known by other narnes as muggu, rangoli and rangavalli) are significant cultural traditions of India, blending art, ingenuity, and culture. The designs vary by region, and the designs consist of grids of dots, with symmetry, repetition, and spatial reasoning embedded in them. The Kolam designs provide a fascinating area of study for their strong mathematical underpinnings. The challenge is to develop computer programs (in any language, preferably Python) to identify the design principles behind the Kolam designs and recreate the kolams.
