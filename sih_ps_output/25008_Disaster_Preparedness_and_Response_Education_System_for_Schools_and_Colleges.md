# Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System for Schools and Colleges

**Problem Statement ID:** 25008

**Organization:** Government of Punjab

**Department:** Department of Higher Education

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Disaster Management

## Description

Problem Description In India, schools and colleges are often unprepared for natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and fires. While emergency guidelines exist on paper, there is a lack of structured disaster management education integrated into the curriculum. Institutions lack digital tools to simulate disaster scenarios or conduct virtual drills to train students and staff on safety protocols. Furthermore, there’s a gap in localized awareness—many students are unaware of how to react during disasters specific to their region. Manual drills, where they occur, are infrequent and often poorly coordinated, failing to instill practical preparedness. Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved Lack of awareness and preparedness leads to panic, chaos, and potentially fatal outcomes during emergencies. By integrating disaster education into regular learning, institutions can equip students and staff with life-saving knowledge and skills. This is especially critical in areas prone to natural calamities. Empowering young people with this knowledge not only makes campuses safer but also contributes to a more disaster-resilient society.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• A digital platform or app that offers interactive disaster education modules, region-specific alerts, and virtual drills. • Gamified learning experiences to improve engagement. • Emergency contact directories and real-time communication tools during disasters. • Dashboards for school administrators to track preparedness scores and drill participation. Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries • Students (K-12 and higher education) • Teachers and administrative staff • Educational institutions and local disaster response teams • Parents and guardians • Government departments (NDMA, Education Ministry) Supporting Data • NDMA reports show low awareness levels in schools despite India’s high disaster vulnerability index. • UNDRR has recommended integrating disaster risk reduction in education policies (Ref: National Disaster Management Authority).
