# Development of Sensor for Detection Of Microplastics

**Problem Statement ID:** 25036

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Description

Background Microplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring. Description The project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.

## Background

Microplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

The expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.
