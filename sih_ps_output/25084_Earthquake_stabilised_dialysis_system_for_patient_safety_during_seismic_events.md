# Earthquake stabilised dialysis system for patient safety during seismic events.

**Problem Statement ID:** 25084

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** HEALTH SERVICE DEPARTMENT

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Disaster Management

## Description

India's substantial chronic kidney disease patient population relies on dialysis services available from sub divisional level hospitals to specialist Centres including mobile units. Current dialysis infrastructure lacks earthquake resistant technology, potentially resulting in treatment interruption and patient mortality during seismic events. A stabilisation system would ensure continuous dialysis delivery during earthquake, safeguarding patient's life.
