# Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for Monitoring aximum
Residue Limits (MRL) and Antimicrobial Usage (AMU) in Livestock

**Problem Statement ID:** 25007

**Organization:** Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

**Department:** Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Description

Background Antimicrobials are vital in ensuring animal health and productivity in modern livestock systems. However, inappropriate and excessive use of these drugs can result in antimicrobial residues in animal-derived food products and contribute to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)—a major global threat to both animal and public health. Monitoring antimicrobial usage (AMU) and ensuring compliance with Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) is crucial to promoting responsible drug use and safeguarding food safety. Problem Description There is a growing need for a digital solution that can help track, monitor, and manage antimicrobial usage across livestock farms while ensuring adherence to MRL standards. The proposed system should serve as a centralized digital portal that facilitates: • Recording and tracking the types, dosages, frequency, and reasons for antimicrobial use in animals both in treatment and through feed. • Integration with veterinary prescriptions and treatment logs to monitor compliance. • Alert systems for withdrawal periods and MRL compliance prior to the sale or processing of animal products. • Real-time dashboards and data visualization tools for analysis of AMU trends across species, regions, and time periods. • Use of blockchain or other secure technologies to ensure data integrity and traceability. • Mobile app interfaces for easy data entry by farmers and veterinarians in field conditions. This digital platform would contribute to improved antimicrobial stewardship, better regulatory enforcement, and help India align with global AMR mitigation strategies, while also strengthening public trust in livestock products.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• Improved antimicrobial stewardship practices at the farm level. • Enhanced compliance with MRL norms and regulatory frameworks. • Real-time availability of data on AMU for authorities and stakeholders. • Data-driven decision-making to inform policy and farm-level action. • Capability for trend analysis and automated reporting. • Healthier livestock and reduction in antimicrobial residues in food. • Improved public health protection and consumer confidence. • Contribution to global AMR reduction efforts. • Better engagement of farmers and veterinarians through digital tools. • Promotion of sustainable and responsible livestock farming practices.
