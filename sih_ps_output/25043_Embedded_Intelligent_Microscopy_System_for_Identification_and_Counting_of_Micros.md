# Embedded Intelligent Microscopy System for Identification and Counting of Microscopic Marine Organisms

**Problem Statement ID:** 25043

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

Background Marine biodiversity assessments rely significantly on microscopic analysis of planktonic organisms, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and other microscopic marine life. Traditionally, counting and species identification require manual microscopic examination, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to human error. AI-enabled embedded microscopy systems provide an effective alternative by automating the identification, classification, and enumeration of these organisms directly at the point of sampling. Description This problem statement envisages developing an embedded intelligent system that can be integrated directly with microscopic imaging devices used in marine biological studies. The system should leverage embedding-based deep learning techniques to identify and count microscopic marine organisms captured through microscopy images. The embedded platform should be optimized for low computational resources, enabling accurate, rapid, and automated analysis without manual intervention. The solution should specifically handle diverse challenges encountered in microscopic imaging, such as overlapping organisms, variations in morphology, illumination inconsistencies, and imaging artifacts. It must accurately classify and quantify different species present in microscopic images to facilitate marine biodiversity assessments efficiently.

## Background

Marine biodiversity assessments rely significantly on microscopic analysis of planktonic organisms, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and other microscopic marine life. Traditionally, counting and species identification require manual microscopic examination, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to human error. AI-enabled embedded microscopy systems provide an effective alternative by automating the identification, classification, and enumeration of these organisms directly at the point of sampling.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

An embedded microscopy-integrated AI system featuring: • Lightweight deep learning models deployable on embedded computational hardware. • Automatic species/genus-level identification of microscopic marine organisms from microscopy images. • Accurate and automated counting of individual organisms per species. • Capability for onboard processing, storage, and reporting of species identification and counts for subsequent ecological analysis.
