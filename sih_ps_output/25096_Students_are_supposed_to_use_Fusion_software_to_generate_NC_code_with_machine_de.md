## Description

Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is the use of software and computer-controlled machinery to automate a manufacturing process. Based on that definition, you need three components for a CAM system to function: Software that tells a machine how to make a product by generating toolpaths. Machinery that can turn raw material into a finished product. Post Processing converts toolpaths into a language machine can understand. From high efficiency roughing with Adaptive Clearing to simplified control of multi-axis machines with Tool Orientation.
