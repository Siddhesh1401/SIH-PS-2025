# Design and Implementation of Solar-Powered Dewatering in Mining Operations.

**Problem Statement ID:** 25072

**Organization:** Ministry of Mines

**Department:** Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Renewable / Sustainable Energy

## Description

Background The current dewatering system at our copper mining site relies heavily on electrically operated pumps , often supplemented by diesel generators during power outages. This traditional setup not only leads to high operational expenses due to electricity and fuel consumption, but also contributes to increased carbon emissions , operational complexity, and maintenance challenges . In light of rising energy costs and the need for reliable and sustainable mine dewatering solutions , there is a pressing need to explore alternative approaches. Solar-powered dewatering systems offer a viable solution, leveraging renewable energy to reduce costs, ensure consistent pump operation, and support broader environmental and sustainability goals . Implementing such systems under an OPEX (Operational Expenditure) model aligns with the strategy to minimize capital expenditure while transitioning to cleaner and more efficient mining practices. Problem This outlines the implementation of solar-powered dewatering pumps at the copper mining site under an OPEX model . The system will integrate solar photovoltaic (PV) modules with energy-efficient submersible or surface pumps , designed to meet site-specific dewatering requirements. A third-party vendor will be engaged to install, operate, and maintain the system through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or operational lease, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment by HCL. The system can be configured as stand-alone solar or hybrid (solar with grid/diesel backup) to ensure uninterrupted pumping. The proposed solution aims to reduce operational energy costs , enhance dewatering reliability , and support environmental commitments by minimizing diesel use and lowering carbon emissions . Technical specifications are attached.
