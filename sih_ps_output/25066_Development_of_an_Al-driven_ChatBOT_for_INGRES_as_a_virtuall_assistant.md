## Description

Background The Assessment of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India is conducted annually by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State/UT Ground Water Departments, under the coordination of the Central Level Expert Group (CLEG), DoWR, RD & GR, MoJS. The assessment uses a GIS-based web application named INGRES (India Ground Water Resource Estimation System), developed by CGWB and IIT Hyderabad ( https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home ). The process estimates annual groundwater recharge, extractable resources, total extraction, and the stage of groundwater extraction for each assessment unit (Block/Mandal/Taluk). Units are categorized as Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited, forming the scientific basis for groundwater management and regulation. Currently, results are published via the INGRES portal, but users face challenges in retrieving results and historical data due to the vast database. Proposed Solution To improve accessibility, it is proposed to develop an AI-driven ChatBOT for INGRES. This intelligent virtual assistant will enable users to easily query groundwater data, access historical and current assessments, and obtain instant insights without navigating complex datasets. Key Features - Intelligent query handling for groundwater estimation data - Real-time access to current and historical assessment results - Interactive scientific diagrams and visualizations - Multilingual support, including Indian regional languages - Seamless integration with the INGRES database for quick information retrieval Impact The AI-powered ChatBOT will enhance user engagement, simplify access to groundwater resource data, and support informed decision-making for planners, researchers, policymakers, and the general public. It will make the INGRES portal more user-friendly, accessible, and effective in disseminating groundwater information.
