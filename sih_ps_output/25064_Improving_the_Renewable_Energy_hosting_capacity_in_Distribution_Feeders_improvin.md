# Improving the Renewable Energy hosting capacity in Distribution Feeders improving the Power quality of Distribution network during high RE injection

**Problem Statement ID:** 25064

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Renewable / Sustainable Energy

## Description

Background Kerala has a large penetration of Roof Top Solar PV systems amounting to nearly 1500 MW. These systems are connected to low voltage distribution feeders either in single-phase or three-phase mode. A majority of the systems are below 5 kW and hence get connected in single-phase, which causes severe unbalanced loading in feeders and results in an uneven voltage profile. This unbalanced loading also limits the quantum of PV that can be integrated into the network. Any load balancing work carried out during daytime under PV injection gets negated during the evening peak hours when solar power is unavailable. This situation calls for a solution that can dynamically reconfigure the network based on renewable energy (RE) injection and local demand scenarios.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

A cost-effective controller incorporating IoT and edge intelligence can be developed at the local node level for auto-balancing of the load across various phases in a feeder under the above conditions.
