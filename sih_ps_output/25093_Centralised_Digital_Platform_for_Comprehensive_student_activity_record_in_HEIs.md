# Centralised Digital Platform for Comprehensive student activity record in HEIs

**Problem Statement ID:** 25093

**Organization:** Government of Jammu and Kashmir

**Department:** Higher Education Department

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Description

Background: Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including: - Conferences and workshops attended - Certifications earned - Club activities and volunteering efforts - Competitions and academic contests - Leadership roles and internships - Community services done This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge. Description: The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform. Key Features include: - Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities. - Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars. - Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility. - Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format. - Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations. - Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms. Impact and Benefits: - Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile. - Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications. - Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations. - Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued. - Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.
