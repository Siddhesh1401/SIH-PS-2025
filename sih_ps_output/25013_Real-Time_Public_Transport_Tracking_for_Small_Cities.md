## Description

Problem Description In small cities and tier-2 towns, public transport systems lack real-time tracking, causing inconvenience to commuters who face unpredictable bus schedules. This leads to overcrowding, wasted time, and reduced reliance on public transport. The problem is acute in cities with growing populations but limited digital infrastructure for transport management. Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved Over 60% of commuters in small cities face delays due to lack of real-time information, reducing public transport usage and increasing private vehicle dependency, which worsens traffic and pollution. A solution would enhance commuter experience and promote sustainable transport.
