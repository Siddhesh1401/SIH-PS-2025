## Description

Problem Statement This problem statement proposes the design and development of prefabricated modular road panels that use bamboo reinforcement and plastic waste-infused composites to build durable, erosion-resistant roads in remote and hilly areas. The solution may be: • Utilize bamboo mesh or strips as structural reinforcement within concrete or stabilized soil panels. • Incorporate processed plastic waste (Low-Density Polyethylene - LDPE, High-Density Polyethylene - HDPE) into the mix to improve water resistance and flexibility. • Include drainage features, slope adaptation mechanisms, and anti-slip surfacing.

## Background

The Northeastern Region faces persistent challenges in building and maintaining rural roads due to difficult terrain, high rainfall, and limited access to conventional construction materials. Simultaneously, plastic waste management remains a growing concern in both urban and semi-urban pockets of the region. Bamboo, abundantly available in NER, offers high tensile strength and flexibility, while recycled plastic enhances water resistance and durability when used in road surfacing. Combining these two materials presents a unique opportunity to create sustainable, modular road infrastructure tailored for NER's needs.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• A prototype modular panel system combining bamboo and recycled plastic. • A deployment guide for constructing 100-200 meter stretches in rural terrain. • Cost-benefit analysis compared to conventional road-building methods. • Environmental impact assessment and scalability roadmap. • Optional integration with IoT-based monitoring for wear and tear tracking.
