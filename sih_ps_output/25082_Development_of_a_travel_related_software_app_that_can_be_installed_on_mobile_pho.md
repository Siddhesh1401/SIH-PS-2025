**Problem Statement ID:** 25082

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** KSCSTE-NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND RESEARCH CENTRE (NATPAC)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Travel & Tourism

## Description

NATPAC is into transportation planning but accurate data collection is a tideous task. Household data collection using manual survey is also time consuming and does not cover even a small percentage of the population making any planning exercise inadequate. Therefore, the problem statement covers development of a travel related software app that can be installed on mobile phones that could capture trip related information - trip number, origin, time, mode, destination etc - such that a travel related activity and trip chain can be established. Also the number and details of the accompanying travellers also can be captured if possible. Consent from the user is required. Some of these details can be automatically detected and some details can be nudged to be filled by the user. Once these trip details are complete, it can be saved in a server/ database which can be accessed by NATPAC Scientists for planning purposes.
