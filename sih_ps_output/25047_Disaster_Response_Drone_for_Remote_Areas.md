# Disaster Response Drone for Remote Areas

**Problem Statement ID:** 25047

**Organization:** Government of Odisha

**Department:** Electronics & IT Department

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Robotics and Drones

## Description

Description Develop a drone-based system to deliver medical supplies and communication devices to remote areas during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes). The drone should use AI for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance, with a payload capacity of at least 5 kg. Expected Outcome A working drone prototype with a mobile app for disaster management teams to coordinate deliveries, reducing response time by 20% in inaccessible regions. Technical Feasibility Employs existing drone hardware with open-source flight control software (e.g., Ardupilot) and AI algorithms for navigation, tested in simulated disaster scenarios.
