# Renewable Energy Monitoring System for Microgrids

**Problem Statement ID:** 25051

**Organization:** Government of Odisha

**Department:** Electronics & IT Department

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Renewable / Sustainable Energy

## Description

Description Develop an IoT-based monitoring system for solar or wind microgrids in rural areas, providing real-time data on energy generation, storage, and consumption. The system should alert users to inefficiencies or maintenance needs. Expected Outcome A hardware-software prototype improving microgrid efficiency by 15%, with a mobile app for community operators to manage energy distribution. Technical Feasibility Employs affordable IoT sensors (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino) and cloud-based analytics for real-time monitoring, compatible with existing microgrid setups.
