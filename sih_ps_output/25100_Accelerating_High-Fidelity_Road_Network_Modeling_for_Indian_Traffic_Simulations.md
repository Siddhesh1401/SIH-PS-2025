## Description

Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors. Manually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted. To address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process. The solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning. Proposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.
