## Description

Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes. Description: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes. Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis. There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.
