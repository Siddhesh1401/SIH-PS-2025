# Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System Determined by the Infection Level of a Plant

**Problem Statement ID:** 25015

**Organization:** Government of Punjab

**Department:** Department of Higher Education

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Description

Problem Description Excessive and indiscriminate application of pesticides in agriculture creates soil degradation, water contamination, damage to useful insects, and health risks for humans and animals. Regardless of whether the plant is healthy or infected, traditional pesticide spraying methods are used evenly, leading to waste and contamination. Many farmers lack affordable, automated systems to monitor crop health and control pesticide usage accordingly. This issue occurs on both large and small farms where manual inspections and sprays are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often inaccurate. An intelligent system is required to recognize pest or disease infection in individual plants and regulate the amount of pesticide sprayed. This ensures optimal use of chemicals, reduces environmental impact, and promotes sustainable agriculture. Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved • Reduces excessive pesticide usage and lowers farming costs. • Protects soil and water quality, while minimizing harm to non-target organisms. • Improves crop yield and quality through precise and timely treatment. • Supports small and marginal farmers with cost savings and better farm sustainability. • Contributes to safe and eco-friendly food production.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• A smart automated system with sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms to detect infection levels. • IoT-controlled sprayer to dispense pesticides only where and when needed. • Mobile or web interface for farmers to monitor plant health and control the system remotely. Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries • Farmers (small, medium, and large scale) • Agricultural extension officers • Agrochemical companies • Environmental agencies • Consumers demanding residue-free produce • Government bodies promoting sustainable farming
