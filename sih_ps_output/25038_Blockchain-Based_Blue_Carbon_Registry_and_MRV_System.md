# Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV System

**Problem Statement ID:** 25038

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** National Centre for Coastal

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Clean & Green Technology

## Description

Background Blue carbon ecosystem restoration is gaining importance in India’s climate strategy. However, there is no decentralized, verifiable Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system that ensures transparency, accuracy, and carbon credit generation. Description Participants are to design a Blockchain-powered registry where: • Verified plantation and restoration data are immutably stored. • Carbon credits are tokenized using smart contracts. • NGOs, communities, and coastal panchayats can be onboarded. • Field data is integrated from apps and drones.

## Background

Blue carbon ecosystem restoration is gaining importance in India’s climate strategy. However, there is no decentralized, verifiable Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system that ensures transparency, accuracy, and carbon credit generation.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• Blockchain app for blue carbon MRV. • Smart contracts for tokenized credits. • Mobile interface for data uploads. • Admin tools for NCCR.
