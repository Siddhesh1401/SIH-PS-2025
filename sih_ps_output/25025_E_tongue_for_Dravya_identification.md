# E tongue for Dravya identification

**Problem Statement ID:** 25025

**Organization:** Ministry of Ayush

**Department:** All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech

## Description

Background In Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems, Rasa (taste) is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency. In the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products. Recent advances in sensor science and analytical technologies provide innovative solutions to these challenges. Electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such as Near-Infrared (NIR), Raman, and UV-Visible spectroscopy offer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples. When integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) —such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition—large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision. This AI-enabled, sensor-integrated approach ensures faster, objective, and cost-effective quality assurance, bridging traditional Ayurvedic principles with modern scientific validation. Detailed Description The problem statement aims to design and develop a sensor-integrated AI-enabled device for objective quality assessment of marketed herbal samples. The device will incorporate: • A multi-sensor e-tongue array to detect basic taste modalities (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent). • A threshold detection module for quantifying the minimum perceptible concentration of each taste-related compound. • Analytical integration with phytochemical profiling techniques (e.g., HPTLC, FTIR, LC-MS) for correlating taste signatures with chemical constituents.

## Expected Solution / Outcomes

• A portable hardware prototype incorporating an electronic tongue (e-tongue) sensor array. • Calibration using authenticated herb samples and machine learning models trained on large datasets of taste and phytochemical fingerprints. • Smart alerts and decision support for detecting adulteration or substandard quality. • A centralized or cloud-compatible database that updates continuously with new samples and learning outputs. • Applicability across industries including Ayurvedic pharmacopeia standardization, herbal industry quality control, academic research, and regulatory bodies.
